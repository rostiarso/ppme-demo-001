This document explains the initial mock-up pages of PPME Website, from techical setup, code and hosting.

### Technical Setup
This demo page has been created with the help of:
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - ***The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites***

* Original content from PPME Google Drive and PPME WordPress site


All the site demo code are stored in GitHub repository [ppme-demo-001](https://github.com/rostiarso/ppme-demo-001), and ***freely*** hosted in [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

With this setup, the developers can checkout the code and build the website locally on their Windows/Mac/Linux machines.
