We have contacted the Indonesian colleagues that helped to create/deploy the current Wordpress website.
These are the requests/questions that we raised:
* TLS certificate need to be set to allow secure connection
* Admin email can send outbound but cannot receive email
* If admin email can receive email, we would then request additional info@ email

~~So far, we have not received any update from the team.~~

### Update 2022-03-11
With the help of mas Ferry, the following is completed:
- [x] Admin email can send outbound but cannot receive email
- [x] If admin email can receive email, we would then request additional info@ email


Still need to be discussed and may introduce cost:
- [ ] TLS certificate need to be set to allow secure connection, for ppmedenhaag.nl, www.ppmedenhaag.nl and webmail.ppmedenhaag.nl. Can either be applied by Wildcard or SAN certificate.
